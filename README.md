## Description

All sites created with WordPress have the same file and directory structure, and the database table structure is simple. So it's easy to imagine that it's a website that is fairly easy to attack from the attacker.
This plugin doesn't easily make visitors aware that your site is written in WordPress and provides robust performance in terms of security. In addition, it retains the versatility of being able to track updates such as cores and plugins as usual.

By using this plugin, we can easily perform troublesome server-side access restrictions and maintenance of various configuration files as likes above from the admin panel.

**Main plugin features:**

* Move WordPress installation directory
* Update and move `wp-config.php`
* `.htaccess` maintenance
* Cleanup HTML that output by WordPress
* Control behavior each route of WP REST API
* Set up a new login page URL
* Restricted access to login page

Let's get rid of our tedious configuration work right away and ignite the launch of the site!

## Installation

1. From the WP admin panel, click "Plugins" -> "Add new".
2. In the browser input box, type "WP Ignitor".
3. Select the "WP Ignitor" plugin and click “Install”.

1, 2, 3: You're done!
